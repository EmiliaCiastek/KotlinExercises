/**
 * We are having a party with amounts of tea and candy. Return the int outcome of the party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, or 2=great.
 * A party is good (1) if both tea and candy are at least 5. However, if either tea or candy is at least double
 * the amount of the other one, the party is great (2).
 * However, in all cases, if either tea or candy is less than 5, the party is always bad (0).
 *
 * Examples:
 * teaParty(6, 8) → 1
 * teaParty(3, 8) → 0
 * teaParty(20, 6) → 2
