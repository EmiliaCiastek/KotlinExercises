 * Given an "out" string length 4, such as "<<>>", and a word, return a new string where the word is in the middle of

 * going up to but not including index j.

 * Examples:
 * makeOutWord("<<>>", "Yay") → "<<Yay>>"
 * makeOutWord("<<>>", "WooHoo") → "<<WooHoo>>"
 * makeOutWord("[[]]", "word") → "[[word]]"
